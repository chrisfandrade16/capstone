\section{Introduction}
This document outlines the stakeholders, requirements, and potential issues in 
developing a progressive web application for the automotive industry. 
The document will serve as a guide for for upcoming design stages, and will 
also provide the stakeholders with a high level description of the application.
The requirements listed in this document will be consulted for validation of
features during development, and to ensure that the scope matches the client's
expectations.

\subsection{The User Business or Background of the Project Effort}
Automobile maintenance and repairs are an unavoidable and recurring part of any
car owner's experience. Despite its ubiquity, acquiring professional auto
service remains a time-consuming and hassle-prone process. Without a systemic
procedure, this process consists of a number of scattered and repetitive tasks,
beginning with finding local providers including mechanics, tire shops, and
body shops through traditional means such as a search engine, with little
assurance of the trustworthiness or service quality of the providers in the
search results.

After obtaining a list of service providers, customers are required to contact
each service professional separately, repeatedly describing the same problems
in order to receive a quote.  Furthermore, different providers may have
different availability. Scheduling a time preferred by the customer at
available auto service providers, therefore, requires further communication
with multiple providers through methods such as phone or in-person visits,
costing additional time and effort.

\section{Goals of the Project}
To address these problems in the auto service industry, The team seeks to deliver
an all-in-one tool that connects customers with auto shop owners and employees for 
frequent tasks such as service inquiries, quotes, and scheduling.

    \begin{itemize}
        \item[G\refstepcounter{goalnum}\thegoalnum \label{R_Output}.] Allow vehicle owners to find automotive service providers based on personal criteria (location, availability, offered services, customer ratings, etc.)

        \item[G\refstepcounter{goalnum}\thegoalnum \label{R_Output}.] Allow automotive service providers to easily get an online presence and increase their customer base.

        \item[G\refstepcounter{goalnum}\thegoalnum \label{R_Output}.] Allow vehicle owners to save time by getting quotes for service on their car from multiple auto shops at a time.

        \item[G\refstepcounter{goalnum}\thegoalnum \label{R_Output}.] Allow automotive service providers to digitize their records.

        \item[G\refstepcounter{goalnum}\thegoalnum \label{R_Output}.] Allow vehicle owners to flexibly schedule their service based on the availability of their desired automotive service provider.

        \item[G\refstepcounter{goalnum}\thegoalnum \label{R_Output}.] Allow automotive service providers to more effectively schedule the use of resources such as vehicle bays and employees.

        \item[G\refstepcounter{goalnum}\thegoalnum \label{R_Output}.] Allow quick communication between vehicle owners and automotive shops for topics such as providing estimates, asking questions or giving general updates on service.

        \item[G\refstepcounter{goalnum}\thegoalnum \label{R_Output}.] Allow vehicle owners to maintain digital records of servicing their vehicle including inspection results, invoices and appointment records.

        \item[G\refstepcounter{goalnum}\thegoalnum \label{R_Output}.] Provide individuals with no background in website/online management a simple and satisfying experience working digitally.
    \end{itemize}

\section{Stakeholders}
\subsection{The Client}
Nabil Ibrahim of Sayyara is the project sponsor and supervisor who stipulates
the scope of the project and verifies the deliverables.
\subsection{The Customers}
Owners of automotive service shops, including body shops, tire shops, and
independent mechanics are the intended customers of the product. The owners
will acquire the license to use the software on behalf of employees and their
potential customers.
\subsection{The Other Stakeholders}
\subsubsection{Developers}
Members of Team 31 are the developers of the application, responsible for the
design, implementation, and testing of the software.
\subsubsection{Capstone Staff}
Dr. Spencer Smith, the instructor of the Software Engineering capstone course
at McMaster University, and his team of teaching assistants are advisors who
provide evaluation and feedback of project deliverables.
\subsubsection{Automotive Part Vendors}
Car part vendors may have a stake in the project as the process of streamlining
auto service client-provider interactions may also include ordering parts
directly or indirectly through the application.

\subsection{The Hands-On Users of the Product}
\subsubsection{Automotive Shop Owners}
Shop owners are responsible for the initial setup of the shop profile in the
application. They may also use the application to monitor performance related
metrics such as customer volume and service statistics. The owners may have
limited experience with web applications, but should at minimum have access to
a computer or mobile device.

\subsubsection{Automotive Shop Employees}
Shop employees are a group of primary users of the software, who interact with
customers through the application to provide services. Employees are adults of
all ages with limited to moderate levels of experience in using web 
applications.

\subsubsection{Automobile Owners}
Car owners are the main group of intended users, who can use the application
to connect to auto shops and schedule for services. There is great diversity in
the age, knowledge, and background among the customers, thus all levels of
technological experience can be expected. At the minimum, they must have 
access to a computer or mobile device with an Internet connection, and have
some previous experience in using the device.

\subsection{Personas}
N/A
\subsection{Priorities Assigned to Users}
N/A
\subsection{User Participation}
Users, regardless of whether it is an automotive shop owner, employee, or customer, will be required to fill out a few forms when they are interacting
with the website. These forms will be as as minimal and simplistic as possible to ensure that users do not get frustrated and exit the application
halfway through what they are working on. Since it is expected that users may not have much technology experience, this process will be made as
comfortable as possible for them.

\subsection{Maintenance Users and Service Technicians}
Team 31 will be the primary maintenance users of the system since they are the developers and will have the most knowledge to debug and fix any issues.
Additional workers may need to be hired on at a later date to assist with maintenance depending on the final scope and outcomes of the project.

\section{Relevant Facts and Assumptions}

\subsection{Relevant Facts}

\begin{itemize}
    \item The product is being specifically designed for use in the automotive industry.
    \item Currently in the automotive industry, 
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Shop owners cannot scale their businesses or retain customers long term as they are unable to compete with dealers when it comes to convenience, availability, and trust.
        \item Shop owners cannot provide accurate time estimates as to when they can work on servicing a customer's vehicle.
        \item Shop owners have a hard time answering all the calls they get on a daily basis.
        \item Customers have a fear of being overcharged.
        \item Customers have to endure a cumbersome process to obtain quotes and book service appointments.
        \item Customers have no digital trail of the work performed on their vehicle.
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Business Rules}
N/A

\subsection{Assumptions}
\begin{itemize}
    \item All users own a computer.
    \item All users have a basic understanding of how to use a computer.
    \item All users have a basic understanding of how to use a web browser.
    \item All customers own a vehicle.
\end{itemize}

\section{The Scope of the Work}

\subsection{The Current Situation}

There is currently no application or service that easily presents a customer, who needs to service their vehicle, with a network of automotive businesses and the option to easily view the businesses' schedules and book an appointment. We will build such a service, where the customer will also have the option to describe their issue in detail and receive a quote from the variety of businesses before committing to any one business. The main service, which will be seen and used by the users, which include vehicles owner, shop owners, and shop employees, will be a PWA. The service is built with the front-end framework React and TypeScript, while the back-end is built using Python. The user database and appointment information are managed by Supabase.

\subsection{Business Data Model}
The business data model illustrated in figure\ref{fig:bdm} defines the foundational entities and associations used in the automotive repair shop. Vehicles are owned by customers and are brought in to be serviced. Vehicles that are serviced are assigned a service order by the service bay manager or generally the owner. A repair shop technician is assigned to the service order. The technician inspects the car and makes repairs to the car. The technician keeps a detailed record of the repairs made on the car, which are routed back to the customer.

\textbf{Note} that the data models related to Inventory, Supplier and Part are a part of the extended goals in the our scope of work and will not be a part of the MVP or POC demo.

\subsection{Unlikely Changes to Requirements}    

\noindent \begin{itemize}

\item[UC\refstepcounter{ucnum}\theucnum\label{UC_meaningfulLabel}.] The application will be a PWA and must run on both desktop and mobile devices and this requirement will not change.

\item[UC\refstepcounter{ucnum}\theucnum\label{UC_meaningfulLabel}.] The application is meant to be designed for users who are not very tech savvy, so features will be simplistic and easy to navigate.

\item[UC\refstepcounter{ucnum}\theucnum\label{UC_meaningfulLabel}.] The intended users of the application are unlikely to change; the application is designed for autmotive shop owners, their employees, and their potential customers.

\item[UC\refstepcounter{ucnum}\theucnum\label{UC_meaningfulLabel}.] It is intended for the application to have a monthly subscription service for shop owners to host their shop and its services on the website.

\section{Project Issues}

\subsection{Open Issues}
\begin {itemize}
    \item Uncertainty in scope \\ 
    A potential issue is the uncertainty in project scope with respect to the 
    limited development time. In the initial meeting, the client envisioned an 
    expansive system with three main views to include the functionalities for 
    the three user groups: shop owners, employees, and customers. The main 
    functions in each component were assigned priority based on their inclusion 
    in the MVP. However, the team determined that the completion of all 
    currently labelled MVP functionality may be difficult due to the time 
    constraint of the February deadline. Further discussions will be conducted 
    with the client to adjust the MVP scope to adapt to this timeline.
    
    \item Payment system\\
    A subscription-based payment system is required for the commercial 
    distribution of the product. No payment options have been explored, and the 
    client is responsible for setting up the required banking and payment 
    routing. Whether the payment system or a mock-up of one should be 
    implemented in the MVP will be a topic of discussion with the client.
\end {itemize}

\subsection{Off-the-Shelf Solutions}

\subsubsection{Ready-Made Products}
A number of existing software offer scheduling, billing, and communication 
tools for auto service shops, covering some but not all of the client 
requirements.

\begin {itemize}
    \item Shop-Ware (\url{www.shop-ware.com}) \\ 
    Shop-Ware is a cloud-based auto shop management software with features such 
    as service analytics, quote generation, employee management, inventory 
    tracking, and digital vehicle inspection. The primary users are shop owners 
    and employees, and as such offers little utility to customers.
    
    \item AutoLeap (\url{www.autoleap.com}) \\
    Similar to Shop-Ware, AutoLeap markets itself as an auto shop workflow 
    optimization software, focusing on features such as inspection report, 
    estimates, invoice generation. It also provides customer-facing features 
    including automated scheduling and Google reviews. However, it is 
    shop-specific and does not feature a centralized hub for customers to 
    contact multiple service providers.
    
    \item Setmore (\url{www.setmore.com/industries/automotive})
    Setmore is a free auto service scheduling tool. Focusing primarily on 
    booking appointments, Setmore offers APIs to display a scheduling calendar 
    on auto shops' own websites, with additional features such as automated 
    mobile reminders. 
\end {itemize}

\subsubsection{Reusable Components}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Front end components and styling can be built on top of existing 
        frameworks such as Bootstrap or MUI.
        \item Google Calendar API can be the basis of the scheduling 
        functionality.
        \item Mobile text notification can be accomplished using available 
        tools such as Twilio API.
    \end{itemize}

\subsection{New Problems}
While switching auto service-related interactions from the traditional 
in-person or phone methods to a centralized online platform will reduce overall 
effort by the customers, its use requires access to mobile or computer devices 
with Internet connections, as well as the basic knowledge of operating such 
devices. While these basic technological experiences have become near 
ubiquitous, it can still potentially preclude some users such as older 
employees or customers.

Shop owners and employees may also require time for the initial training or 
practice for using the application. The myriad of shop-facing functions imply 
that, even with an intuitive, user-friendly design, some acclimatization may 
still be required.

Additionally, the platform is only as responsive as the shops that it hosts. 
The asynchronous options of online communication may result in tardiness in 
shop-customer communications compared to traditional contact methods.



\subsection{Tasks}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Architectural design of the full application is expected to be 
    completed by October 20, 2022. 
    \item The full team will work on the customer, employee, and shop owner 
    views concurrently, with feature-based tasks assigned to individual members 
    according to expertise. Please refer to the Development Plan for a detailed 
    breakdown of the feature-branch workflow.
    \item A few core functions for each view will be implemented in a mock-up 
    back end, to be displayed on skeletal front end designs for the POC 
    demonstration by November 13.
    \item Additional features corresponding to the requirements are to be 
    implemented before February 3, 2023.
    \item Unit testing is carried out during the development of each feature. 
    While systematic testing is conducted monthly.
    \item Updates to the requirements and implementation are to be discussed 
    and formulated based on regular weekly meetings between the development 
    team and the client.
    
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Migration to the New Product}
The initial setup of the software requires the shop owners to register an 
account or profile for their shop, and perform owner-specific configurations 
such as granting access permissions to employees. The employees are required to 
install the software on their devices, and familiarize with use cases such as 
responding to scheduling requests, and preparing online service reports. The 
software is expected to work in tandem with traditional real time contact 
methods, and so does not replace phone or in-person contacts in the foreseeable 
future.

\subsection{Risks}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Due to limited time, the team will focus primarily on developing the 
    main features rather than application security. As such, the MVP may have 
    little protection against malicious security exploits.
    \item The development build will use mock data provided by the client. 
    There is a risk that the system may not scale up readily to accommodate 
    high-volume real traffic and data, as traffic-stress testing is beyond 
    purview of the MVP.
    \item The team consists of six developers of varying levels of experience 
    and areas of expertise. Consequently there exists the risk of stylistic 
    differences in different components of the application as a side effect of 
    the feature-branch workflow. Coding standards and the pull request review 
    process will alleviate some of the differences but full consistency may be 
    difficult to achieve during the short development period.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Costs}

The permitted budget for the project is \$750. Being an entirely software 
project, the development cost of the project is expected to be small. The team 
plans to use free or low-cost hosting services to deploy the development build. 
The available budget may be used to purchase commercial framework or library to 
assist in the development.\\

Moreover, there is heavy emphasis on deploying and testing locally to further save on testing costs. These cost savings do not transfer to deployment when real customers start using the product, therefore the following estimates are highly variable and prone to noise.\\

\begin{table}
    \begin{tabularx}{\textwidth}{l X}
        \toprule
        \textbf{Service} & \textbf{Cost} \\
        \midrule
        Database Storage & \$0/month during development, Bundled in the server hosting costs\\
        Server Hosting & variable depending on usage, starts at \$10/month\\
        Website Domain Name & \$20/year\\
        \bottomrule
    \end{tabularx}
    \caption{Costs}
\end{table}


\subsection{User Documentation and Training}
N/A
\subsection{Waiting Room}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Auto service features that requires domain-specific knowledge such as 
    onboard diagnostic report are valuable extensions to the tool that can be 
    developed post-MVP.
    \item Customer and employee account features such as configurations and 
    customization are not a part of the MVP but should be included in future 
    builds.
    \item Artificial intelligence integration should be explored for features 
    such as quote generation, scheduling, and analytics.

\section*{Appendix --- Reflection}

The team will collectively need to acquire and hone a variety of skills, 
technical and otherwise, in order to successfully complete this project. The 
implementation of the full stack application will require fluency in languages 
such as Python, Javascript, HTML, and CSS, as well as applicable packages and 
frameworks such as NodeJS, ReactJS, and databases. For a commercially 
marketable product, the team will also need to practice concepts such as 
user-centered design in UI/UX. 

Beyond technical skills, the team will learn to work together on a strict 
timeline through project management, communication, and constructive feedback. 
Such communication can include writing project documents, annotating the code, 
and providing or receiving feedback at regular meetings. The delivery of the 
final product arguably depends more on successful and consistent teamwork 
rather than individual technical skills.


\begin{itemize}

        During my work term I had the opportunity to learn about full stack web development. During this time, I developed front end skills using JavaScript and the React framework. I also had the opportunity to extensively work with Python for both the back end of the web application and also had the opportunity to use it to automate tasks to triage a continuous integration system. One aspect of full stack web development that I would like to acquire more experience and knowledge in is database management. A lot of databases I was working with were already created so I just needed to write simple SELECT queries and so I would like to acquire more knowledge in the creation of databases and the relationships between them. These databases were SQL-based, so learning more about no-SQL databases is something I am interested in as well. I plan to research side-projects that incorporate a database management system. I also plan to research online courses that can teach me more about databases. Since I learn best by doing, I plan to pursue a side-project that incorporates a database management system so I can get hands-on experience that will be memorable and beneficial to this capstone project.

        I have worked in full stack development and currently have experience
         in web technologies such as Node, React as well as other application 
         designs using C\# and Python. An avid believer of learning-by-doing, I 
         am interested to gain additional familiarity in industry development 
         environment by working on this project using practices such as CI/CD 
         and the feature-branch workflow.

        I currently have skills in front-end development using JavaScript, HTML, CSS, and frameworks like React, Redux, Sass, and more. Mostly, my skills pertain to user interface design. I now plan on learning Python back end skills to create a web server with authentication, and query data in a database, as these skills will be required for the project. These are things I haven't done much before. In order to do this, I will reach out to colleagues of mine who are familiar in Python back end and database management, and I will also be doing tiny small projects/challenges on the side with the help of online video tutorials to learn more. The latter will be what I pursue, because in the past I learned the basics of JavaScript needed to make a front end app using that method.

        I have had experience in building and deploying high performance webapps at Tesla during my previous internship, where I leveraged NextJS and Python to create highly configurable static website generator with online content search functionality. Moreover, I have had experience in front-end development with TypeScript and React. This is especially important as the future platform of web is being build with frameworks like React. I plan on writing more applications around the recent breakthrough of LLM's(Large Language Models) and diffusion networks.

    \item Ethan Vince-Budan \\
        I currently do not have any experience with full stack development, although I do have some experience with languages and frameworks which may come in handy during this project. I have in the past worked on many standalone projects written in Python, Java, C, and some Lua. These projects are generally hosted on platforms which make use of git, which I have used for version control, issue tracking and a limited amount of CI/CD. Evidently I have a lot to learn about front-end development using React, which I intend to learn through online courses and forums such as Stack Overflow as I enjoy self-directed learning and experimentation. I predict that the back end workflow will be easier for me to adapt to as I have way more experience with related tech.

        I have had a lot of experience with full stack development. My experience started when I joined the DeltaHacks club here at McMaster as part of the technical team.. I was on the team for just shy of 2 years. I had to use Vue.Js, TypeScript, and Firebase (NoSQL) as part of the tech stack. I also had spent some time there designing easy to use interfaces as there would be hundreds af applicants using the application we were creating and maintaining. I also gained a good deal of experience working with the back end as part of my 12 month co-op. I used Go in order to create new APIs as well as update old, existing ones. During my 3 month co-op at Amazon, I was using TypeScript exclusively and had experience eliciting requirements, creating and writing design documents, as well as building an internal tool from he ground up using cloud (AWS) technologies, namely Lambda, DynamoDB, Step Functions, and CloudWatch/EventBridge. Outside of all this, I already had experience with Python while doing personal projects, coursework, and is my preferred programming language. Overall, I think I am well equipped with the necessary skillset in order to successfully complete this capstone project.
